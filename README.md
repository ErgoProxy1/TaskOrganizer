# TaskOrganizer (WIP)
Side project I got started on in Feb 2025, just to build a simple task organization app using ASP.NET Rest APIs and various frontend frameworks (Currently working on sharpening and showcasing my knowledge of WPF, and then I might also build more frontends for Web and Mobile)

The plan is:
## Backend (ASP.NET REST)
1. **User Authentication**: Implement user registration and login functionality. [**Done, UI will be cleaned up later, look into storing JWT**]
2. **Task CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks.
3. **Task Assignment**: Allow users to assign tasks to different users.
4. **Task Status Tracking**: Track the status of tasks (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
5. **Due Dates and Reminders**: Set due dates for tasks and send reminders.

## Frontend (WPF)
1. **User Interface**: Design a clean and intuitive UI for managing tasks.
2. **Task List View**: Display tasks in a list with filtering and sorting options.
3. **Task Details View**: Show detailed information about a selected task.
4. **Task Creation and Editing**: Provide forms for creating and editing tasks.
5. **Notifications**: Display notifications for task reminders and status changes.

## Additional Features
- **Search Functionality**: Implement search to quickly find tasks.
- **User Roles**: Differentiate between admin and regular users with role-based access control.
- **Activity Log**: Keep a log of all actions performed by users for auditing purposes.
- **Fully Functional profiles**: Profile pics, user settings, login/signup [**In Progress**]
